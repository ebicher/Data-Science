For each of these scenarios decide if you could use supervised or unsupervised techniques, or both!

    Define the likelihood that an individual will contract a specific disease
    
    -Supervised learning. You could do a classification model and have it predict the probability.
    
    Translate a set of images into variables for modeling
    
    -Unsupervised Learning.
    
    An ecommerce company wants to identify power users
    
    -Unsupervised learning, or possibily supervised learning using a classification model. (ex. Poweruser = 1)
    
    That same company wants to see shopping patterns in users
    
    -Unsupervised learning.
    
    You want to reduce the number of variables inputting into your random forest model
    
    -Unsupervised learning using PCA. Or you could do supervised and look at feature importance.

If any of these scenarios are unclear feel free to follow up with your mentor.
