    "1. My ideal job would be a job working with machine learning, deep learning and predictive algorithms to analysis big data sources. I want to build neural networks to help businesses make the right decisions. It would be nice to work with a small agile team that commmunicates well and works quickly. Working remotely would be a plus but not a necessity."

You build them kind of like brains, in the sense that they are networks of connected pathways that problem solve. I'll basically be building the programs that hopefully one day will have a mind of their own. "
