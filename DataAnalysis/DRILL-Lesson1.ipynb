    "#### 1. You work at an e-commerce company that sells three goods: widgets, doodads, and fizzbangs. The head of advertising asks you which they should feature in their new advertising campaign. You have data on individual visitors' sessions (activity on a website, pageviews, and purchases), as well as whether or not those users converted from an advertisement for that session. You also have the cost and price information for the goods."

    "Well you can calculate what good is most likely viewed and purchased by users from an advertisement. You can also calculate which would make the company the most money. If the widget is .50 dollars and 75% of users who see the advertisement buy it, that is good, but if the fizzbang is 5000 dollars and although only 10% of the users buy it, it would be more profitable. You could also look at the activity on website to see if you should change it. For instance, if 50% of people who buy widgets buy doodads, then maybe the company should offer a combination package, or just advertise for doodads on the widget page. "
